# News file for Cartero

## [0.1.0] - 2024-07-26

Initial release. I've crafted a MVP that consolidates the most important features to start using Cartero. Some features has been delayed for a future release, but there is already enough features for it to be useful.

### Added

* A fully functional HTTP client with support for multiple request methods, and payload types.
* A variable engine that allows to move things such as API keys, passwords or hostnames into a variable that can be injected later into the URL or other headers.
* File support to load and store requests for a future session.
